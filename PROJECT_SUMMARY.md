- **Color Preferences**: 10 color options with mood associations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Python Flask)
- **File**: `backend/app.py`
- **Framework**: Flask with CORS support
- **Features**:
  - RESTful API with 4 endpoints
  - Intelligent recommendation algorithm
  - Color psychology integration
  - Regional and weather-based filtering
  - Confidence scoring system

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism design
- **Icons**: Lucide React for beautiful UI elements
- **Features**:
  - Modern, responsive design
  - Interactive form with visual color picker
  - Real-time API integration
  - Loading states and animations
  - Mobile-friendly interface

## 🚀 Key Features

### Smart Recommendation Engine
- Multi-factor analysis combining emotion, weather, region, and color
- Confidence scoring (85-98% range)
- Category mapping (casual, formal, party) based on emotions
- Weather-appropriate suggestions

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Psychology Integration
Each color has associated mood descriptions:
- **Red**: Passionate and bold
- **Blue**: Calm and trustworthy
- **Green**: Natural and harmonious
- **Yellow**: Cheerful and energetic
- **Purple**: Creative and luxurious
- **Pink**: Romantic and feminine
- **Black**: Elegant and sophisticated

- **Brown**: Earthy and stable

### Emotion-Based Categorization
- **Formal**: Professional, confident, elegant emotions
- **Party**: Happy, playful emotions
- **Casual**: Relaxed, romantic emotions

### Weather-Aware Recommendations
Each weather condition has appropriate dress suggestions:
- **Sunny**: Light, breathable fabrics and bright styles
- **Rainy**: Layered looks and weather-appropriate materials
- **Cloudy**: Versatile pieces for transitional weather
- **Cold**: Warm materials and cozy styles

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Algorithm
1. **Input Processing**: Validates and normalizes user inputs
2. **Category Mapping**: Maps emotions to dress categories
3. **Weather Filtering**: Selects weather-appropriate options
4. **Personalization**: Applies color psychology and regional preferences
5. **Scoring**: Generates confidence scores for recommendations

### Frontend State Management
- React hooks for state management
- Controlled components for form inputs
- API integration with Axios
- Loading states and error handling

### Styling Approach
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Custom color palette and typography
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop filters
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## 🚀 Setup and Deployment

### Quick Start
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh --setup
```

### Manual Setup
1. Backend: `cd backend && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 app.py`
2. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`

### Access Points
